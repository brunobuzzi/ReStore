# ReStore 2.00
ReStore - transparent relational database storage for Dolphin Smalltalk

# Getting Started
* Install [Dolphin Smalltalk 7.1](https://github.com/dolphinsmalltalk/Dolphin)
* This repository should then be cloned/downloaded to your Dolphin working directory
* Install package `ReStore\examples\customer and orders` - this will load all required prerequisites
* See package comment for instructions to setup an ODBC database, and classes and code examples for persisting and querying objects

For further information please see the legacy [1.20 documentation](http://www.solutionsoft.co.uk/restore/manual/contents.htm).
This is generally still relevant, however please refer to the `customer and orders` package examples for new usage patterns
